## Zero marginal cost

In the last 20 years, the internet has upended much of how we consume information. By driving the cost of distribution to (near) zero, it is now possible for anyone to publish content, from blogs to tweets to photos to videos.

It is hard to understate just how powerful this transformation has been for so many industries and business models. For example, we went from a world where the news was largely dominated by a small number of TV and news stations, to one where nearly any voice can dominate the conversation (for better and for worse). We went from a world where a select group of individuals in Hollywood decided what entertainment would be produced, to a world where anyone can start a YouTube channel or make a TikTok video and reach an audience (again, for better and for worse).

One unifying theme behind these changes is a shift in _gatekeepers_. Previously, it was expensive to produce and distribute content. Newspapers needed to be printed on physical paper, video equipment and editing equipment was expensive, music needed to be recorded and distributed on physical media. Money accrued to the companies and organizations that _controlled distribution_.

The internet, however, changed the rules of the game. Content was no longer expensive to distribute. Anyone could publish a blog on WordPress or make a video on YouTube. The previous gatekeepers no longer controlled content, which means they no longer made as much money. Not surprisingly, [many](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/03/21/what-happened-to-the-piracy-sites-that-nearly-destroyed-the-music-industry-part-1-napster/?sh=542c0f362293) [battles](https://www.wired.com/story/can-australia-force-google-facebook-pay-news/) [ensued](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2016-17/may-june/law-youtubers-next-generation-creators-legal-issues-they-face/) to determine the rulers of this new terrain.

For some reason, however, the world of academic publishing has largely remained unchanged. In a pre-internet world, the gatekeepers were academic journals, as they controlled distribution (publishing of academic papers). However, despite the fact that the modern internet has been around for around twenty years, these previous gatekeepers (academic journals) remain. What gives?

### Why doesnâ€™t it work?

- Not enough people. Community is too small for these forces to take effect.
- Intermediary. Instead of consumers paying for content directly, academic journals are intermediated by universities and libraries. This is enough of a wrinkle to maintain the status quo. Much like the distinction between consumer and enterprise software.
