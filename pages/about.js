          <h4>Machine learning and neuroscience research</h4>
          <p>I am interested in developing tools and analyses for understanding exactly <em>how</em> machine learning models work. Currently, I conduct this work on the <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brain Team</a> at Google Research.</p>
          <p>Previously, I completed my PhD in neuroscience in the labs of <a href="https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surya Ganguli</a> and <a href="https://baccuslab.sites.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Baccus</a> at Stanford University, where I studied neural circuits in the retina. My research focused on bringing together computational models and data from electrophysiological experiments to better understand how we process visual information.</p>
          <p>Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, working on open source projects, and playing soccer. I majored in biomedical and electrical & computer engineering at Duke University. Before that, I attended the SC Governor&rsquo;s School for Science and Math (<a href="https://www.scgssm.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSSM</a>) in Hartsville, SC. I grew up in Rock Hill, South Carolina.</p>
